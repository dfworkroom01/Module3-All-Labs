Readme:

The website is a website of a fake Charity NGO operating in Singapore.
The NGO is working on people with disabilities (PWD) so they can be active members of society.
The NGO believes that charity must be fact-oriented as facts provide insights into the root cause.
Therefore, the NGO has asked me to develop a website that integrates a snippet of their data.

The data is about reasons for PWD not working.
It has 200 data points divided by year and reasons for not working.  
However, the NGO wants to pilot data from 2021 to 2023 only as the minimum value case of the new site.
The website is limitedly responsive, but it will be entirely responsive to more gadgets.
